#### Mind in action & passion

Week 2

*Topics*

Alienated and non-alienated relations to elements of one's own psychic life. What is it for a belief, desire, enjoyment or other motivation to be truly 'one's own'? What what is the importance of this difference? Can we grasp the ordinary notion of identification through its connection to activity? What would the relevant notion of activity have to be? What distinguishes persons from other creatures capable of action, and what is it that we want when we want our wills to be 'free'? 

The nature of desire and its relation to reasons. Active and passive relations to one's desires. Freedom, authority, and their relation to self-knowledge. Is self-knowledge essentially different from the knowledge you may have of another person, as Moran and Korsgaard suggest? How does a person 'know his own mind' as to what he intends to do, and how is this different from coming to have predictive knowledge of what someone will do? How in particular does Moran see this as a matter of being guided by norms or reasons?

#### The evaluation of feeling and affection

Week 3


*Topics*

Continuation of the topics raised in week 2 with a focus on Moran's essay. And exploration of the idea that living a good life does not just involve acting well but feeling well, and the questions this idea raises. What kind of standard do we appeal to when thinking about whether a feeling--our own or another’s--is appropriate? And if feelings can be evaluated, then must we be in control of them? 

In the following meetings we will investigate how these questions and others arise in connection some concrete phenomenon: love, grief, anger and shame.

### Part II: Puzzles of ordinary life: love, grief, love and shame


#### Love: its object, basis and unity

Weeks 4 & 5

*Topics*

Transition to concrete facts of human life: If Moran (Korsgaard and Kosman) are right that we are to understand the relevant notion of identification and activity though the connection to reasons and justification, specifically in self-conscious deliberation, then what are we to make of the sort of connection or dependence or relation to another called love? to be mine or to identify with such desire must i understand it at the very least to be open to rational assessment?

*Even further topics*

Why does the lover want to be loved? Are there reasons for love? Is there a conflict between the demands of love and the demands of freedom and autonomy? Is there a conflict between the demands of love and the demands of impartial morality or justice? What are the desires characteristic of different types of love? What is the relation of sex and love? What distinguishes 'normal' love from neurotic and perverse love? What role does the declaration of love (“I love you”) play in the constitution of the relationship itself?

J-P Sartre, *Being and Nothingness*, III.3: Concrete Relations with Others, parts I and II [pdf](https://www.dropbox.com/s/r9vki6kck3abz09/sartre-concrete-relations.pdf?dl=0). (In contrast with Nozick who thinks that love is a form of unity of persons, Sartre thinks *love is a conflict*.)

  - Some topics raised by Sartre here: The paradoxes of love as the desire for possession, on the one hand, and love as the desire to be recognized and loved by a being essentially free, hence beyond one's possession. Are certain forms of love and desire inherently self-defeating? How so? What forms of desire, if any, may avoid this? What does it mean that sadism is the failure of desire.

  - The discussion itself presupposes earlier treatment of 'the existence of others' in part three chaapter one (see above link). Some relevant themes include: the existence of other people as a problem of knowledge (the problem of other minds) and as the possibility of being known; as a limitation of one's freedom and as the condition of the very possibility of one's freedom. Being subject to the gaze of another person ('the look'), and acknowledging the existence of others through such attitudes as love and shame.

## Grief, loss & time

Weeks 6 & 7

*Topics*

Does failure to experience grief at the death of someone close show lack of love? Is grief a disease? Can grief and depression be distinguished? Is it ever fitting to be depressed? Does grief serve a purpose? Does mourning? Is there any reason (justification) for the way in which grief tends to dissipate over time?

*Readings*

Berislav Marušić, 'Do reasons expire? an essay on grief', [pdf](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sdeq58uv9k7uhif/do-reasons-expire-an-essay-on-grief.pdf?dl=0)

  <!-- - Abstract: Suppose we suffer a loss, such as the death of a loved one. In light of her death, we will typically feel grief, as it seems we should. After all, our loved one’s death is a reason for grief. Yet with the passage of time, our grief will typically diminish, and this seems somehow all right. However, our reason for grief ostensibly remains the same, since the passage of time does not undo our loss. How, then, could it not be wrong for grief to diminish? Or how are we to make sense of the diminution of grief? Do reasons expire? —The paper clarifies the puzzle and then considers four responses. It argues that all of them are inadequate and that there are principled reasons why this should be so: In experiencing grief we are apprehending a loss. Yet in our effort to understand the diminution of grief, we must apprehend ourselves. But because grief is not about ourselves, our apprehension of the diminution of grief is at odds with our apprehension of the object of grief. This gives rise to a kind of double-vision, which is why the puzzle eludes a solution.  -->

## Anger, insult & injury

Week 8

What is anger? How are we to understand the nature of anger? Is it distinct from hatred, vengefulness, resentment and the like? How is anger linked to taking revenge? Why do we feel anger? How if at all is anger linked to self-esteem? Does it express low self-esteem, for example? How related to honor? Does anger reveal anything about our dependnece on others? Is it ever permissible to feel and express anger? Would a good person be angry in certain circumstances? If it is sometimes right to be angry, what could explain why and when one should cease to be angry?
