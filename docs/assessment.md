Due date is for the summative essay is **TBD**.

In addition to the summative essay, each week students will bring to seminar a written question on an assigned reading. We are a larger group than anticipated. It is even more important that everyone arrive prepared to contribute to the discussion.

Formative essay

You are strongly encouraged to write a formative essay by the end of reading week. We will take some time to talk about philosophical writing early in the term. [Jim Pryor's guidelines for writing a philosophy paper](http://www.jimpryor.net/teaching/guidelines/writing.html) are a very useful place to start.
