## Discussion questions

Students are expected to do the all of the assigned reading prior to each seminar. In preparation students should write up a substantial question about one of the readings. Please bring a copy to class. We are a large group. It is even more important, then, that everyone arrive ready to contribute.

I will setup a page for real time collaborative editing with additional features. Please feel free to contribute any comments, questions, passing thoughts or extended arguments. Coming soon!
