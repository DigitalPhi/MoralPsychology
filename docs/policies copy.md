### Weekly discussion questions

Students are expected to do the all of the assigned reading prior to each lecture. In preparation for our weekly discussion sections, students are expected to write out a substantial question about one of the readings. Please bring a copy to class.


### Tools, skills and tips

You are strongly encouraged to write a formative essay by the end of reading week. We will take some time to talk about philosophical writing early in the term.

Jim Pryor's very helpful guidelines on:

- [reading philosphy](http://www.jimpryor.net/teaching/guidelines/reading.html)

- [writing philosophy](http://www.jimpryor.net/teaching/guidelines/writing.html)

Automated feedback tool from [*ecree*](https://www.ecree.com/signup). I will set-up an account for our module. It a very useful tool.

Some writing exercises for bringing narrative into the rational order of a philosophical essay will be posted here.

### Attendance, deadlines and plagarism

Regular attendance is a requirement of the course, and attendance will be taken. You will need to attend at least 70% of the classes in order for your work to be submitted for assessment.

Strict penalties are applied when an essay is submitted late. These are normally waived only for medical reasons, provided that documentary evidence is submitted.

Make sure to cite every source (web-based or otherwise) you draw upon in writing your essays. If in doubt, ask an instructor for guidance or consult UCL's official [statement](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/current-students/guidelines/plagiarism).


### Email policy

Please use email *only* to set up a one-on-one meeting with me if office hours conflict with your schedule. Your message should include at least two times when you would like to meet and a brief (one-two sentence) description of the reason for the meeting. Email sent for another reason may not receive a reply. Please do not expect me to reply right away (I may not reply on time). If there is an emergency, talk to me later during class or office hours.

I strongly encourage you to ask questions about the syllabus, covered material, and assignments during class time or seminar discussions. Our conversations should take place in person rather than via email. Philosophy and intellectual community take root through conversation and not over email. We all stand to benefit from keeeping email to a minimum.
