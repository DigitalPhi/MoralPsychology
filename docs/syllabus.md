### November 17 - Anger

What is anger? How are we to understand the nature of anger? Is it distinct from hatred, vengefulness, resentment and the like? How is anger linked to taking revenge? Why do we feel anger? How if at all is anger linked to self-esteem? Does it express low self-esteem, for example? How related to honor? Does anger reveal anything about our dependnece on others? Is it ever permissible to feel and express anger? Would a good person be angry in certain circumstances? If it is sometimes right to be angry, what could explain why and when one should cease to be angry?
