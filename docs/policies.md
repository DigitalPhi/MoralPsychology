# Policies

## Tools, skills and tips

1. Discussion questions
You are strongly encouraged to write a formative essay by the end of reading week. We will take some time to talk about philosophical writing early in the term.

2. Jim Pryor's very helpful guidelines on:
    + [reading philosphy](http://www.jimpryor.net/teaching/guidelines/reading.html)

    + [writing philosophy](http://www.jimpryor.net/teaching/guidelines/writing.html)

3. Automated feedback tool from [*ecree*](https://www.ecree.com/signup). It can be a useful tool. I will set-up an account for our module.

4. Some writing exercises for bringing narrative into the rational order of a philosophical essay as well as a few model essays will be posted here later in the term.

5. Please contribute any comments, questions or passing thoughts [here](https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/moralpsychology). It is a page for real time collaborative editing with lots of additional features. Just click the link and write.


## Attendance, deadlines and plagarism

Regular attendance is a requirement of all modules at UCL. According to that policy students must attend at least 70% of the classes in order for work to be eligible for assessment.

Penalties are applied when an essay is submitted late. These are normally waived only for medical reasons, provided that documentary evidence is submitted.

Make sure to cite every source (web-based or otherwise) you draw upon in writing essays. If in doubt, ask an instructor for guidance or consult UCL's official statement [link](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/current-students/guidelines/plagiarism).


## Email

Please use email *only* to set up a one-on-one meeting with me if office hours conflict with your schedule. Your message should include at least two times when you would like to meet and a brief (one-two sentence) description of the reason for the meeting. Email sent for another reason may not receive a reply. Please do not expect me to reply right away (I may not reply on time). If there is an emergency, talk to me later during class or office hours.

I strongly encourage you to ask questions about the syllabus, covered material, and assignments during class time or seminar discussions. Our conversations should take place in person rather than via email. Philosophy and intellectual community take root through conversation and not over email. We all stand to benefit from keeeping email to a minimum.

Think this is too cranky? Look here: [Email is destroying us all...](http://www.emailcharter.org/). And look here: [it really is](http://two.sentenc.es/).
