Some topics that might be taken-up: love & hate, authority & obedience, shame & pride, respect & humiliation, pleasure & pain, self-control, competitiveness & equality, hope & despair, fear & grief, anger, forgiveness & apology. This module is meant to be exploratory within the limits of reason and polite society. Let's all do our best.

### Meetings

- Discussion sessions: Mondays 1500-1600 (weeks 7,9,12,14,16), Gordon Square (19) 102

There is a discussion session this Monday, *October 9th*. They're fortnightly from then on. These classes are not mandatory, so you do not have to come. However, you are strongly encouraged to do so! Last year the students found them very beneficial. We had some really excellent in depth discussions about the material. On the whole, we cover the same terrain as the texts set for class reading. The sessions are an opportunity for you to ask questions you didn't get to ask in class, or take further lines of inquiry which you weren't able to in the full group.

This week, we'll look at G.E.M. Anscombe's paper 'Modern Moral Philosophy'. We'll talk a bit about what moral psychology might be and how there might be a place in it for feeling and passion in addition to choice and action.


### Course materials

All the substantive course content will be available here on this course website. This module is work in progress. There may be a few, minor changes going forward.

A folder with all the assigned and supplemental readings will be posted soon [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6co6o1lykiw13uf/AAAOD2ZQkDpU9psqM2IndYbia?dl=0). At present, you will find links to individual readings in the detailed schedule of topics [below](#schedule).

We will use the UCL [Moodle](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=39769) only to send announcements and as the portal for submitting and receiving summative essays.
