Some topics that might be taken-up: love & hate, authority & obedience, shame & pride, respect & humiliation, pleasure & pain, self-control, competitiveness & equality, hope & despair, fear & grief, anger, forgiveness & apology.

### Meetings

- Seminar: Thursday 1600-1800, Gordon Square (19) 102 [(map)](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/maps/19-gordon-square)

- Discussion sessions: Mondays 1500-1600 (weeks 7,9,12,14,16), Gordon Square (19) 102

There is a discussion session this Monday, *October 9th*. They're fortnightly from then on. These classes are not mandatory, so you do not have to come. However, you are strongly encouraged to do so! Last year the students found them very beneficial. We had some really excellent in depth discussions about the material. On the whole, we cover the same terrain as the texts set for class reading. The sessions are an opportunity for you to ask questions you didn't get to ask in class, or take further lines of inquiry which you weren't able to in the full group.

This week, we'll look at G.E.M. Anscombe's paper 'Modern Moral Philosophy'. We'll talk a bit about what moral psychology might be and how there might be a place in it for feeling and passion in addition to choice and action.
